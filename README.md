# Userscripts

A little collection of userscripts I've written to make websites a little less
annoying and reclaim some sanity. All the scripts are in the `scripts` directory
as one would imagine.

You can install and use them through Greasemonkey, Firemonkey, Tampermonkey,
Violentmonkey (the one I use for Firefox), etc.
